# Medical-appointment-noshows-analysis

## Introduction

This dataset collects information from over 100K medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment? A number of characteristics about the patient are included in the dataset description. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) on kaggle.
